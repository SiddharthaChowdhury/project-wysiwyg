## Layout generator

###How to use:
It is very important to know, how the "Layout builder" works!

**Color Indications:**

- background `blue`: <Selected> When you click on a component in the layout
- background `yellow`: <Hover> When you hover your mouse over a component in the layout;
- outline <span style="border: 1px solid orange; padding: 3px;">`orange`</span>: <Hover>

**Layout builder behaviour**:

- Component that contains child/children can not contain text
- In component containing text, if new child(row/columns) is inserted, the text will be removed.
- A component can have at most 4 children (rows/columns)
- A new component (component without another component(row/column) inside) can have either rows or columns as its immediate children.
- By default there is no limit to a total of how many components you can create. However it is recommended to keep it as minimum as possible as the layout its not really mobile friendly   

###Getting started?

1. Click/Select the work area to start with
2. Once the work area is selected it will turn "blue"
3. Now you can insert new "Rows" and "Columns" the way you want your layout to look like
